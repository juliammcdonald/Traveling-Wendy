Labor Plan

Xinhui:
Preliminary GUI
  -Explore using JGraphT to plot graph

Julia:
Create txt file with coordinates for wellesley buildings, intersections, and roads
Find or create Graph, Edge, and Node classes (possibly from javafoundations)
Create WellesleyGraph class that extends Graph and has txt file parsing method, 
  dijkstra's algorithm method (to be implemented together), and functionality to aid in GUI display.

Together:
Figure out Dijkstra's Algorithm and implement it
Polish GUI
Create runner class (name TBD) that displays GUI and allows for testing
Test by comparing to data from Google Maps

**Credit University of Rochester CS Faculty for idea of using txt file coordinate system for buildings, intersections, and roads**
